# django-blog-project
It is a simple django project consisting of blogs which are segragated by categories and a number of blogs maybe
a part of the same series.
Its a simple application so many security features might be absent and also because it was made to sharpen my django skills.

To test the application on your local machine, follow the following steps:
> - Open the directory containing the manage.py file and on the command line interface, run the following command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
> - Open the generated link in your web browser.
